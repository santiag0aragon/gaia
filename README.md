# The Generative AI Architecture (GAIA)


The Generative AI Architecture was created to help entrepreneurs to build new GAI startups by providing a framework which enables an end-to-end view of the key areas of a company in the generative space. GAIA provides a structured high-level view of the ten strategic areas a Generative AI company must address to become and remain relevant.
